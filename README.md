## How to use

1. **Clone or Download the GitHub Repository:**
   First, you need to obtain the extension code from the repository. You can either clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file.

2. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   Before you can load an unpacked extension, you need to enable Developer Mode in your Chrome or Edge browser. Here's how:

   - **Google Chrome:**
     1. Open Chrome and click on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner to open the menu.
     2. Go to "More tools" and select "Extensions."
     3. In the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the on position.

   - **Microsoft Edge:**
     1. Open Edge and click on the three horizontal dots in the upper right corner to open the menu.
     2. Go to "Extensions."
     3. In the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the on position.

3. **Load the Unpacked Extension:**
   Now that Developer Mode is enabled, you can load the unpacked extension:

   - **Google Chrome:**
     1. In the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), click on the "Load unpacked" button.
     2. Browse to the location where you cloned or extracted the GitHub repository, and select the extension's root directory (it should contain a manifest file and the extension code).
     3. Click the "Select Folder" or "Open" button to load the extension.

   - **Microsoft Edge:**
     1. In the Extensions page (edge://extensions/), click on the "Load unpacked" button.
     2. Navigate to the location where you cloned or extracted the GitHub repository, and select the extension's root directory.
